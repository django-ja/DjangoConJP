Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

## In short

  body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
* We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
* Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

  Donâ€™t publish individual photographs of people without their consent.

## Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive
to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for DjangoCongress JP.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
